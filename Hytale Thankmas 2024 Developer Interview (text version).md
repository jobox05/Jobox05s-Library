## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
How is it going, guys? I am It's gonna be good. Live with the wonderful people, in in thankmas, and and and, Buddha Cat, I believe, we have not spoken in a few days. So I wanna just catch up with you real quick and then maybe we can get into the rest of this segment. 
Now, I'm just gonna do what I always do which is a quick audio check for you, while I try and figure out, if I'm muted or not.
Which is like a classic practice that I like to do just to make sure that we don't waste more time on the stream because there's too much cool stuff. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Have you enjoyed thankmas so far by the way, Buddha? It's it's been incredible. It's just been just an absolute, insane thankmas so far.
And the I- it's been really awesome seeing the team just kind of freaking out on our Slack, just over, like, every little thing, the animations, and the figure, and the beat saber, and just, like, everything.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Everything has just been so awesome. I like, genuinely, the community has pulled through in such an awesome way, this year. It's it's been a year where we've really opened up our doors and allowed, other members of the community from all aspects to just get involved and volunteer. 
And obviously, we do that every year, but this time more so, we really really wanted to, get some of the newer members of the community involved and excited, because they've got so much energy! I love the energy that they've got!
It's insane. I I genuinely love it. So, yeah. I mean, I don't know if you you have anything for us today, Buddhacat, because it's a it's a special occasion. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Well, first of all, I I just wanna just just as a side note, I- I- I'm on the server.
Right? But I keep going AFK because I'm, like, juggling so many different things. And so, like, I'll I just have a kind of up and running behind the things, and I'll come back, and I'm in a completely new location. And I and I realized that someone just pushed me off of a cliff, I think. And I Yikes.
Respond. So that's a fun, like, separate mini game, to get you guys as an incentive, I suppose, to donate to get on the server. Push me around, because I'm constantly going AFK. But yeah. I it's it's been really fun to see the reaction so far to the coins.

Yes. That is it's it's really great. And just, I yeah. Good luck to those winners. It's really cool.
I I would love to kind of up the ante, though, with your permission. 
## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Wait. What?

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
If that's okay. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yeah. Hey. We don't hear that often in the world of Hytale. Upping the ante is, like, a royalty. That's interesting. I like that.
I like that a lot. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Can't help it. You know, when it comes to the community, we we can't help it. We we just sometimes have a hard time, you know, not upping the ante. So, yeah, the coins, awesome.
Super cool, like, one of a kind, like, coins. They're just amazing quality too. They're really heavy. They're fun to fidget with and look cool displayed, and but I'd like to up that ante by saying we'd like to give you a little bit more. So we we have, I think, 3 mystery boxes, that official Hypixel Studios mystery boxes.
And in these mystery boxes are are are like hoodie and t shirt. It's like some kind of clothing, possibly a hat. You know, it's a mystery. Who knows? But there's a whole there's a whole bunch of goodies in there, and this really kind of cool looking box.
It's got, like, a magnetic little seal and stuff on it. I don't know. I'm gonna leave it up to you though, Connor, to, figure out how you want that incentive to go. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yes. So I need to make sure that I get this right.
So I'm pretty sure that we have set the donation to go live, and it should be live around this moment now on, the Tiltify page. I don't if, if any of the the goal checkers are listening live, if you guys wanna let me know if that isn't, we can obviously set it live. But effectively, I believe it is $10, for an entry to get a mystery box. Correct? Hey, yo.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I believe that's correct. I I think so. I think so. And good luck to to those people because they're very, very cool. Official.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Official! Official! Official mystery box! You. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I apologize.
That was, you know, my reaction time. You're good. I'm excited too. I'm trying to contain myself because I I, you know, I also have another surprise here. I So, 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
I have a- a- a Kweebec coin obscuring who, the or what the surprise may be.
I will let you lead into it now. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yeah. You know, so let's let's address the the the elephant in the room, the the ask Hytale shaped elephant in the room here. So I know that there haven't been many ask Hytales, in the last several months. You know, it's it's been a really, really crazy, intense year for us.

And, to be honest, it's been hard, like, keeping up with all of your guys' questions. It's been it's been, it's been intense. And, but I I figured the best way to catch up on this big kind of backlog of questions and, like, kind of, answering a lot of these frequently asked questions that we receive is to invite the one and only John Hendricks. -John Hytale. 

## John Hytale (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Oh. Yeah. Hi. It's me, John. Hello, John Hytale.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
It's John Hytale? What? What? It's the John.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yes. How's it going, man?

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
I'm turning up the music, by the way. You can't hear it, but the stream can. It's exciting now.
We're we're we're hyped. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Oh, I see. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
We've got John in the chat. We've got John in the music. Let's go.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Is it like is it like, is it like super hype music? 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
I don't know what track it is, and I I think it's just a transition to a new track. I I the stream chat can tell tell you what chat. The chat, it's a minigame. Guess the name of the stream.
I'm gonna stop talking now. It's John. It's John Hytale. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yay. John Hytale's here.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Hey. Hey. John Hytale's here. Hey. Hey.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yeah. It's it's oh, yeah. That's right. You guys -you guys met, in- in- at during Hycon.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
We did. It was absolutely amazing to meet you, and I remember, yeah, you walked in with, I think, Moo, Sean was, walked in and and and and Noxie and yourself, and I got to meet everybody. It was really, really exciting, and then got to do my talk. And, yeah, thank you so much for having me. Thank you for preparing.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yeah. No worries. Thank you. Yeah. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
It was so hospitable.
Absolutely. Absolutely loved it. I mean, I've ranted on it in pretty much every video I've released since, but, you know, so I'll save I'll save everybody the extra descriptions. But, yeah, thank you so much. Appreciate it, and I hope you're doing well.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I love I love thank this. I've, been here every year. The first one was just a couple months after I started on the team. So it's like a holiday tradition at the house. Like, we have, you know, we make hot chocolate and, you know, pancakes.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
So we crank up the TV. We watch the whole stream every year. It's awesome. I love that so much because that's, like, really similar to what we do as well. I think and I I can speak for several other people in the team.
This is like a a kinda end of the year, holiday, big, cozy tradition for all of us. So it's awesome to hear that you do the same thing. You know what? I I actually I can I can kick things, like, questions wise? I can kick things off with a pretty easy one for you.

What do you actually do, John Hytale? I think everyone, you know, knows the kind of game director side of things, but I don't think there's context behind that. But there's more to what you do. So what is it exactly What would you say you do here exactly? Yeah.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yeah. So I am the game director. I'm also the EP, so the executive producer. And what that really means is I'm responsible for the team and processes. So right so all the different disciplines and how they're working together on the project and then also, the project itself, the game Hytale, which is a lot of fun.

And as a game director I get to be really involved with the design team which is super fun but, that's what I do. So my day is a lot of meetings then I get rewarded by getting to play through prototypes and review designs and new creatives. So that's that's that's awesome. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Speaking of of play tests and stuff like that, you just got back from several meetings, speaking of meetings too, with Riot this week. Right?

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
What? 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yeah. Yeah. Hey. No joke.
We we really did fly out yesterday early to make sure we'd be home in time for this. 
Yeah. I was just down in down in LA at Riot, which we do a lot, as you can imagine. So went through our big end of year. And if, I guess I just recapped all the things I do.

So those are all the things that we talk about in those meetings. Right? So we Mhmm. Meet up with the team there and we talk about the plan and the project and where we're at. Lots of stuff that make a great outline for a blog post, I've been told by many, many people.

Yeah. So that helps as well. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Hint. Hint. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Hint. Hint. And it was really fun because, with Blancs as our big deliverable this year, we got to play the game with everyone down there. And so we took over a play test lab and filled it up, and it was really fun. We went through and we played in the new engine, creative play. We played a bunch of adventure experiencing.
We had some crafting. We were fighting those, the skeletons from the Halloween. I'm not gonna preview too much stuff. Okay?
Actually, I probably shouldn't. I probably shouldn't stop talking. But there was like, you know, it was competitive. There was like there was social, online, local. What else do we do?
A lot of stuff. We're around the capitol. It was really fun. Yeah. So we just just came back from that.
That was on yeah. That was on, like, Wednesday Thursday. And then just me and a bunch of our our friends down there. The Riot thing is really cool. So I've done this a couple of times before.
Right? So I was in Xbox and, and Paramount before that. And, they're all different relationships, right, when you're making a game and you're also part of a big group. And I think the part that I enjoy the most is everyone everyone at Riot just wants this to be a great game. 
Right? They're like their kind of philosophy in in this is, hey, you you know, Hypixel knows this genre. Right? You know what you're trying to make. 
You have to bring the magic, we're just here to help you. Right? And that, is just a a really great feeling. So I I'm, like, I'm riding high right now. I'm super hyper off of, off of all week of all week and being here.

When I'm excited, I try to say, like, 5 things at once, which is also why this, this update is called Blonks. I got hyper and in all hands with the group, and I was trying to I was trying to say I don't know. I was trying to merge the word, like, I guess, block in my mind and, bonk stick because we had a mini game we were calling bonk sticks, like a knockback. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yeah. It was it was filling in the blanks. Right? Or something like that?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I don't know what my mind and mouth were trying to do, but they said blonks, and then I saw the chat kinda blow up. And I'm like, oh, no. I just I just named the update didnt I.
And then I went, yep. You did do that. That's it. That's it. So that's that's how we got Blonks.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
That's amazing. Yeah. 


(Here, Connor once again stays muted)


...Oh, boy. Apparently, they're saying, Connor, we can't hear you. You're muted, bro. Silence and then someone also said that the music is too loud. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Okay. Thank you for that check. Let me turn the music down.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
It's it's a really nice sentiment too. It was so it was so great, and he also just revealed, the the release date. Oh, man. What did I actually say? I I'm trying to I'm trying to backtrack on what I actually said...

## Lee (here to save the day)
Connor your mic.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Thank you, Lee. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Lee.
Oh. Hi, Lee. How you doing? Sorry, chat. I apologize.
Alright. Let me backtrack real quick. What did I just say real quick? Blonks. Oh, Blonks is cool.
Blanks is cool. It's a cool way to frame things. Summer of development update was really good to see how Blonk's, it was able to explain things that I didn't personally understand until the Blonk's thing, it worked. And so that's brilliant. Thank you.
I'm done. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Oh, it just it was more genuine the first time. It was. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
It was so much better the first time. It was, Yeah.
Yeah. We proceeded. It's always better the first time. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Still special. Okay. What do we got? 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yeah. So, you know, I I I figure kind of, best way to get into answering some of the community's frequently asked questions is is just to kick things off with a a bit of rapid fire. Is that okay with you, John? 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Of course.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Alright. So, these these these are some of the questions I- I- I gathered that I would say there's probably dozens, dozens, just even in the last few months of people asking this of some kind. You know, just reworded a little bit here and there. But, first and foremost, will there still be a public alphabeta before the game is, like, fully released? 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yes.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Look at that. The the the classic, Jon Hytale, yes. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yes and. Yes and, please. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Oh, you want more than that?
What? Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, it's a huge part of our process. Right?

So we have a bunch of phases of playtesting that goes on in labs, both, like, internally with the studio and then with external people like we do with our combat playtest. Most when we just we announced that one. Right? Yeah.
I always have to think back to, like, what have we said publicly? But I'll just I'll just run with it. And then we go into several levels of alpha. So we have a level of alpha that is, of course, the studio, and that goes out to, like, friends and family and riot. And then we have a external version of alpha and then we go into beta and the same thing for, for beta of course and with this, the game as big as Hytale you also have to imagine that that's gonna be staggered a bit across the different types of gameplay.

Okay. So there's a yes, and for you. Fine. Yeah. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
That was a yes, and.
## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Those are really one yes, and. The rest are just gonna be yes. Yeah. We do yeah. It was like it's, I was gonna say we get 3, but nope.
We get one. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
So in Hytale, can you have pets? 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Oh, of course. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Okay and can you own more than 1?
## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
...Yes. But do you really, like, own a pet? 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Oh, boy. I can't-

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
-we have this whole thing with a personal thing. It's about pets.
Right? Like, because I I think just kinda more broadly about companions. Right? Because isn't that what you really want? Right?
Do you want a a pet, or do you want something that goes out and, like, grows and explores with you? 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
You don't own your bond, you know. Yeah.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I'm and also companions is much more it's much more broad. Like, at what point does, like okay. Here. I'll I'll I'll play to, to someone very specific mostly if they know who they are. At what point, like, is the moss horn, like, a mount, a pet, or a companion?

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
That's that's a very good point. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Oh, yeah. It's a very good point. I don't know. Because we put casserole in our animation.

Casserole is the Gordon's Mosshorn pet or companion. I that's a good Right. Way of yeah. It's a interesting. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I would argue Mosshorn is a lifestyle.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
I don't know if Chris would agree with you on that one. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Alright. Will there be an offline mode of Hytale? Yes. Yeah.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I think I've I've answered this one before. There'll be local play, including local play offline. I I think creative mode's perfect for that. Okay. Alright.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
And this one is a is a is a bit of a niche one, but I'm gonna do it just for the meme. There's an account that I've seen that's, like, day 231 of asking if Hytale will be released before 2030. So let's just get that out of the way. Will Hytale be released before 2030?


## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yes.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
It will be released before 2030. Begone, naysayers!

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
That's right. That's right. No asterisk required.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Okay. So we're we're we're actually starting to get a bit spicier as we're moving along here. I like this. This is good. Will there be some form of automation in Hytale?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I I I love automation. I made the first, I'm not supposed to reference other games, but ima do anyway. I made it the first drowned farm.
That's my claim to fame. But I love I love Satisfactory. I love platformers. Like I like to think about things kind of, you know beyond just levers and switches. Right?
Like so super into logic play and the the surprise things that happen from that. I've built many, many a flying machine, never for a practical purpose, even though I pretend they are. Yeah. I'm super into it.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
That's awesome. I'm I I I would say more than half of the team is, like Oh my god. Huge, like, factory of, fans or, like, satisfactory fans and Yeah. That's awesome.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
That's really fun to hear about actually. I am I'm I'm not one for, like, building overly complex things, but, like, if I do it, it's always for something really silly. Like, like, producing a cookie or something and just, like, all the automation is just to get all the ingredients of the cookie in the right place. I like that stuff. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I actually I actually love that.
I think that's that's actually really, really cool. That, if there's any sort of game that allows you to have that much kind of freedom within, like, their their environment or their sandbox or whatever, that can let you do something for, like, a meme or just to be silly or just to, you know, just because. You know? Just because I I'm I'm making I wanna do all this stuff to to make a cookie. Why?
Just because. You know? And I think that's that's really cool. It's actually really powerful. Alright.
And- and this one I've seen I don't know I don't know if something what's in the zeitgeist right now, but especially in the last, like, 6 months. 

And I know Reddoons especially has asked me this before, but do you, John Hendricks, foresee the possibility of esports in Hytale, or just like some form of competitive play in the future?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Competitive play? Absolutely. I think esports has to kind of choose you though.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I agree. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I don't think you're allowed to declare you're an esport. I agree. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yep. It's a definitely community led thing in my opinion, for sure.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yeah. I think at what level does a game become like it's like shades of gray, I guess, because there's so many different variables to it. Yeah. And I guess a large part of it is zeitgeist-driven. Right?

I like, where the where the people are at with the mindset towards it. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
For sure. And, like, you think about, like, some, like, the biggest events out there, even, like, the, like, the Smash Brothers was, like, the first one that came to mind. It's all community led. You know?

I mean, obviously, there's there's ones that, you know, either, like, brands or corporations or whatever can, you know, run and and and and organize themselves. But, I would say I would argue for the most part, it's very community led and operated. So yeah. Very, very cool. Alright.

Let's get into if, so a bit of, like, those are the bit more of the rapid fire ones. I'm gonna get more into some of the, like, general frequently asked Hytales. Just like if we could say that as frequently asked questions.

Is the capital **just** a hub space, would you say?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
No.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Oh, wow. That is that's the that's a classic. That's a classic John. No. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
No. And...?

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
There we go. Okay. I'm- I was waiting for it too. I'm like, is Connor gonna is it Connor gonna challenge, or is it gonna me?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Like, am I gonna get away with that? Probably not. No. I think, you know, one thing that's really interesting about the the capital, and I love the capital, is thinking about how it can play a role for every type of player of Hytale. Right?

Because I think people are are used to seeing, like when you think of a hub, I think, you think a lot of a lobby, you think about competitive play and and leaderboards. And that's that's important. Right?
It's important to be able to go and, we use the term, you know, peacocking. It's it's good to be able to go in, like, peacock, like, can allow you to show off things that you have.

Right? And also kind of inspire other people is a lot of fun. But what does it mean to an adventurer? Right? Like, what does it mean to just a purely social player?

Like, what fun social things can you do inside this space? How can, creative players and even creators engage as well? Right? And then it's it's starting to become more of like, more than a lobby and more of an actual, like, main place to hang out for the game. Like, a capital for the game that kinda connects you to all the different aspects of the game, but also to players across those different different areas.

That's what I get excited about, which is super challenging to think about it. Like, it's it's really hard to make it a space that works for that many different types of players. And also that many types different types of, kind of what's the word I want to use for this I'll say things from different creators right as well so you know we don't want the capital b entirely to be entirely Orbis themed. Right? It should be like, Orbis is one of the worlds that you experience.

Right? It's one of the things you go out and take part in. But if all the players are world creating avatars and if the capital is a place that they come to socialize and share with each other, it should have creations from all these other worlds they're making as well. Right? It should feel like it's something that's kind of been built up from them.

And if you've seen the the concept art we've shown before of the kind of floating islands we love islands, floating islands in the void. It's like I don't know. I think we just kinda we always picture things that way. I love this idea that these world creating avatars live on like a shattered world and they're fine with it. Like yeah this is this is this is where we hang out.
Like you know come to the world that I've really crafted. Like that's the one I want to show you now. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Oh interesting. Yeah. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Does that make sense?

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yeah. It's it's ethereal and shard like. I love that. Ethereal. That's, that's, that's good.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
And shard, it's I don't wanna give too much away. But, yeah, that's a that's a that's a good word for it too. Interesting. And I know people are gonna want us to keep, talking about this, but I've got a huge list of-
how are we on time right now, Connor? 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
We're good. You guys take all the time you need. Well, I don't wanna take all the time because this is your guys' show. We're just we're just here to to hang out for a little bit. That's why we look good.

We appreciate it. Thank you guys so much. Aw. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Well, thank you. So, I I this one, I would I I I think ever since especially ever since the announcement of the engine swap and, and everything, I've I've received this in every possible way:
This question in every single form and way. But, it goes something like this. I wanna make sure I'm ready to mod and create in Hytale when it releases. What can I do right now to to learn or be prepared, when that happens? 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Oh, that's a good one.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
That's a great question. You know, I think a part of that's why we do the technical explainers as well. Right to start to show some process and what we're talking about I think the the Lua announcement probably a pretty important one right if you want to get into scripting I don't want to one thing I want to skip over is like what you can do in the game without learning external tools or what you can like augment through external tools and process right there's a lot of one of my favorite things about this genre of game is how much you can create while you're still in the game right without learning Lua without learning like other outside tools but yes of course if you want to really extend and go beyond that would be one thing I would point at one of the things we've kind of mentioned in the past I always tell everybody to learn blockbench so don't ever hesitate to learn Blockbench I think that's always a great idea great program let me see Noesis for UI - Noesis studio is a good thing if you want to tweak UI a lot but I think those things you can kind of pick up right and I think a part of part of our like commitment or job in this too, is like, we can't just say like, Oh, Hey, we're using Noesis.

So go figure that out over there. Right. We have to also help people like modify UI and be ready to, to make their, their own creations. I've got, I'm so close to breaking into jail. I just all the time.

Like, I it's easy to get me talking. But, but, you know, it is important though that we also support people. Right? And that it is, we always say, like, you know, we're gonna let you use the tools that we use. Like, we're designing them in a way that you can also make things a lot more to that.

I think if you unpack that sentence, right, that statement, it means we can't just say, like, yeah, go find, you know, go find the modeler and figure it out. Right? We have to also kind of walk you through how we do it and what we've learned and then hopefully also learn from other people. You know, So my favorite things too is, like, we'll learn a lot, that we'll use from creators who who find cool tricks or cool ways to, to improve a workflow, and that's awesome. There's a whole bunch of of that as well.
Yeah. I mean, I'll just stop right there. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yeah. That's that's great. I love that though. You can really tell that the mentality behind, like, appreciating creators, you know, on an individual level. Like, I spoke about this in my talk this year, but, like, so much of it is about that, like, getting down to that granular level of being able to, you know, make things accessible, expressive, like, all those things. And, you really tell that you guys clearly think about that. You know, it's a heavy heavy principle within Hypixel Studios, which is great.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I appreciate that.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yeah. Yeah. I think another thing really quick is, it's also when we think about how we're gonna do something like, you know, tell the story of Orbis, right, which we put a lot of- a lot of love and energy into, we have to make sure that we're telling it in a way that someone else can also tell the story. Right? I think it's it's when you're, you know, especially when you're building a new engine up, right, it's a great opportunity to go, cool.
This is how we're gonna do it. How hard would it be for someone else to tell the story as big as this?
And we really, really pushed ourselves to make it as easy as we can. Right? So it's like we wanna make sure that we're not doing things with some kind of an outrageous advantage.
Like, we can make a mini game of a certain type, but you can't make one that's quite as good. Right? Or or you can't customize the leaderboards of the menu or something. Like, there's just, you know, there's things you run into. Right?
Like, the frustrations when you jump in, you use something that has, like, really rigid default templates that are based off of the first party experience. You know, first party in this being, like, the industry term for, like, the gameplay we make ourselves. Mhmm. And I think, you know, I think that's kind of also the difference between when you have when you have like a level editor versus like empowering creators with tools. Right?

Yeah. There's a lot of games that's like, hey, we released our level editor. So if you wanna make a reskin of our game, use our level editor. It's set up for that versus, like, hey, we've used these tools to make this game. We've also thought about the games you wanna make.

And so we made these tools in such a way that you can also do things that we are not doing because they're we're kinda counting on you to also come in and explore and challenge. I think that's really fun. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
I love that you made that distinction because I've seen that challenge before in that exact way. What's the difference between the Hytale then and, like, some, you know, x game with x level editor? So I really that's that's awesome that you highlighted that.


## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
I I think that's so interesting as well. Like, the whole idea that, like, Orbis is attainable. Like, it is achievable, and that is something that yeah. Like, you don't wanna you know, there's so many things. Right?

You get tools and you think, yeah. But, like, how am I ever gonna use these tools to make that? Right? And it's just not even a possibility. But, like, the the idea that this incredible world that people are already, like, excited for and that, you know, when we jump into it, I'm sure we'll find is an incredibly fun filled world.

That that is something that can be not, duplicated but replicated in its essence like in terms of like other people, you know, coming in and doing all sorts of awesome stuff in the community. Like so excites me. It gets me so stoked. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
That's awesome. I love that.
I love hearing That's, like, my favorite thing is just, like, hearing firsthand how excited everybody is. Because it it it you know, I do my best to try to also convey that to the team, and it motivates them to try to fulfill that so that, you know, you guys are able to get your hands on that one day. Yeah. And speaking of Orbis and everything, how much influence would you say does the actual story have on gameplay in adventure mode?
Or does it take more backseat?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
That's that's actually kind of a tricky question. Well, because sometimes I get, you know, I get, you'll hear me answer like, you know, not on Orbis, but in in Hytale. Like answers when people, ask ask me questions where it's something that, like, well, we might not be doing that, but you could do that kind of a thing. Right?

Yeah. So we want to the whole thing would be able to make your own world. We want you to be able to make your own world without having to create every block from scratch. Right? So if you wanna make your own version of Orbis, right, and and modify it and change it and tell a story with it or just, you know, just play in it, of course, that's, like, absolutely there.

And you can in that, kind of play loop, you can ignore a story. Right? You can be like, well, actually, I don't want to include that part of the story, or I'm not as interested in spiders or maybe things that people often exclude in games. But we also want to very explicitly tell a story because we do have a really deep story we want to tell about Gaia and Varyn in the world of Orbis. And there's a lot of history that we can even kind of dive into, you know, and go through and whatnot.

So, I guess that's kind of, I don't mean that to be a yes yes or like a double answer kind of a thing, but, we do want it that if you wanna really dig in and be a part of the story and experience it, that that's there for you, but it's not forced. Does that make sense? Is that what they're going for with the question? 


## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
I think so. Yeah. That that actually answers it perfectly, I think. That's brilliant.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
And if you if I'm I'm this is gonna be a bit spicier.
But this one, from the last, technical explainer, I had a feeling that people were gonna pick up on this. I just didn't I guess I didn't participate the core community to, for it to gain as much traction as it did within the core community. And that is, what are player islands? Without giving too much away because we don't wanna get into too much of, like, spoiler territory here, you know, it will all obviously, we'll be talking about it more and more next year. Yeah.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
What what are player islands, John? I was theorizing my video. Islands. I was theorizing. And, yeah.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
So if you can elaborate a little bit on that, John. I'm sure the community will love that.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I was just checking the time though. I think we're over for the next section already. Oh, no.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
No. It's cool. We the whole stream is behind because we're delayed. So Alright. We can keep you.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Yeah. That's good. It's good. Not trying to wiggle out. I was laughing because sometimes the, sometimes we, like kind of slide something in in the background, you know, and try to reveal something soft and some people don't catch them and it's hilarious.

And sometimes, people catch things that are unintended, you know, especially when they're going through the job descriptions, right? And we're trying to get a certain type of person with certain kind of experience and they then take right and we're trying to get a certain type of person with a certain kind of experience and they then take that as being like, oh that must be exactly what they're doing. But sometimes it's also like spot on and sometimes we don't notice that we write something like player islands into into a I tend to explain it. We're like, oh, we haven't really talked about that. Yeah, I think the the easy and of course you also of course are very aware of our background and the things we've worked on in the past.

Much like with the capital, it's like how could we not have a space for players to express themselves, right? Like how could it how could we not do that? Like that has to be like if you're this world creating avatar, we're working this big shattered world, like how could a a chunk of that shattered world not be something that you're using to kind of tell your story the the tricky thing there oh shield those in the chat the sorry the tricky thing there is is how again do we make that space useful to players across all those game modes? So the same challenge we talked about with the capital because we I'd hate to give someone a personal space but then there's like a mid max right way to use it. Right?

So you want it to be important and and critical, but not something that's, like, just there for people who want to, what's the comment I went by in chat earlier or something about not fight? I don't wanna fight Varyn, I've got too much corn to grow or something like that. You know, we just wanna be make sure it's also a space that, the different player types can express themselves with. But yes, player islands are something we're super into.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Awesome. That's so cool. I love that. Does that help at all, Connor? That does it does itch the Like, the itch. I'm liking that. That's that's really that's that's good. I I dig. I dig.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
That's awesome. I just saw someone, say, like, we've known about, is it Luoyu? Luau? I've heard people say in different ways. But either way, they've known about that because of previous job descriptions.

But there there was quite a lot of people who didn't know. I guess this I guess this was a way for us to confirm in regards to our modding language. I think for our modders and and future creators and stuff like that, I think the big question that they wanna know is why we chose this. And I I know it's a fairly technical question, John, but I if there's like some form of summary, like kind of high level summary that you could give. Yeah.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
I think the highest level one is just, you know, you have to go the scripting language. Lua made a lot of sense and then that flavor of Lua just has some perf and security benefits. Yeah. That's it. 
That was one of those calls like you you give to the people who have to use it all the time, right? And so the engineering team and the tech design team are the ones that need people to work on the tools.
They're the ones who make those calls. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Can I ask a little, improv question just on the extent of the back end of that? Please. As someone who doesn't know how to code, in fact, I I started a year of college learning an outdated, coding language which we found out at the end of the year. So like I know a fair few things like about like the basics but, you know, I'm probably gonna be looking into like, learning Lua U or whatever it may be because I know it's gonna be quite important and it's great that you guys have, you know, let us know about it it so that, you know, anyone that maybe hasn't got the most, tech savvy skills can maybe start looking into maybe, learning a bit about it.
I don't know if you guys had any more to say on that, but I think it's really interesting. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yeah. Absolutely. I don't have anything more more to comment on that unless John does. 
Perfect. Awesome. Well, I- I- I- I- I- I- I know this might give you a heart attack, Connor. But we we actually have another surprise. We have the the mystery boxes, we have a John Hytale. There's another thing though. Get out of town. To kind of to kind of go into this a little bit, I have one more question, for for Jon, which is, do you think any any sort of, like any creators in general will be able to get their hands on tools early? 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Okay I see what you're doing.
Yeah it's like where's it going with this? Yeah you know that's a big thing for like I mentioned all the play tests we just went through and we talked before about our goals for the end of this year we're all about getting that, I refer to as, like, a horizontal slice of Hytale of the engine. So we've been working on this engine for quite some time, which everyone's very aware of. We made it really obvious that we're not a date driven studio. We're driving for quality and you know one of the reasons why I know I get a lot of a lot of flack for not like announcing dates I'm not going to give any dates out today but I will talk about kind of what we're doing one of the reasons for that is being quality driven.

Like, we set these goals for ourselves, and the goal for end of this year was to have the engine in place and our systems on top of it to the point that we can start getting back into play tests. Right? Getting back into what is essentially like porting our gameplay then over. Right? From the old engine, from the old playtest that we had, and proving it out.

And super excited about that. And one of the reasons why, you know, that was as far as I would declare because if this last week we had gone into the build and looked at it and said, yeah it's not ready, we wouldn't, you know, cancel the project or, cut, you know, half of the gameplay. We would just say, okay, well in that case what will it take to get from here to being ready? Thankfully, it went really well. And so I can talk a little bit about, like, kind of our focus of the new year.
The some things I'm really excited about okay- Yeah. Sorry. Unless you don't want me to. I gotta know, like, if we're out of time, we could just No.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
We could. We could. Please do. Please talk. No.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
No. No. No. We're good. We're so good.

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
Just kidding. Yeah. I well, jumping into new gameplay in the year and looking at getting back to combat, like, I really enjoyed the combat playtest quite a bit. And, you know, combat was a big motivator for the new engine as well. Right?

We talked about, having an engine that was more capable across platform, like, more easily extended, through creator tools in such a way as well were big deals, but it was also, you know, straight up performance. And we got to a point with the combat prototype, which we got about as far as we could, and it was really fun, but we're like, ah, like, we're gonna need the new engine, like, for the next step for this. And so super excited to get that in the new engine in the new year. The combat is still fairly basic, what we played through right now, so it hasn't caught up to that yet. So I'm excited about that.

And so we'll do that through some competitive play. Creative play is looking really good, and so we're super excited about creative play and getting that to the next level in new engine. And then, of course, there's a bunch of stuff around our world gen, and our NPCs and Orbis. But our focus in the first half of the year will be on that, on, on the competitive play and on creative. 
And a big reason for that is one of our big goals for next year is to bring our 1st creator, into Hytale.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Oh, god. Hey, yo. That's awesome. That's great. 

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
-Which should be super super exciting because again like I we always talk about like launching a game like this is starting a conversation.

Right? It's like starting a conversation with players and we we don't want to go too far forward without having that conversation. Right? And we don't wanna, like, jump out and launch before we've had the conversation. So we're, like, well, when should we have, like, our first creators come in and start to tell us what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, right?

And we're, like, well, let's do it. Like, let's get ready. And so we're gonna really focus, in the first half of the year on being ready for that. And then our goal is to bring a creator in. So that was a big thing I wanna talk about.

And then and now I understand the segue I'm trying to make here. And then, you know, also speaking of the playtest that we did, I think this probably makes sense then to share out a little bit of the creative play. We captured some of that playtest, in the new engine, which I I don't think. Have we shown footage from the new engine yet to anybody? Other than the the, like, you know, the static scene with the camera kind of panning into the last one, just kind of showing where we were getting with visuals.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yeah. Alright so let's do alright world premiere then. Alright there we go. This is world exclusive. Here we go.

//Here: Playtest Video

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
They said that it wasn't real. They said it couldn't happen, but oh my gosh. That was so insane. The chat- chat, that was incredible.

The chat is going crazy. How cool was that? I had to play it twice. It was that cool because I was actually freaking out behind the microphone. Like, dude, everyone's safe.

So there's a few questions in chat. New OST question mark slash is this on the new engine question mark?

## John Hendricks (Hypixel Studios, Game Director and Executive Producer)
New yep. All yep. This is the this is captured in the, in the new engine.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yes. That is a never never before heard, Hytale song. I was waiting for Slamma's reaction. I thought, I- I, you know, people I think talking about branches. But hey.

We're, you know, getting there. But we're getting there, branches will return. Every yeah, everything everything that you guys, loved about, legacy engine branches. Well, fruits are. But yes.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
By the way, guys, donate to hytalethankmas.com because we are still taking donations. This is this is insane. This is crazy. I can't believe what we've just seen. Like give it up chat.

Let's w in the chat, man. That's crazy. I'm so hyped right now. You've got me like animalistic. I don't know what else to say.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yeah. Yep. We came bearing gifts, and I hope you all enjoyed.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Is there any any more context behind that clip or or, are you gonna leave us with that? 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
You know, we'll be talking all that.
We'll be we'll be resharing that. I just saw I just saw my my daughter in the chat. I'm sorry. 

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Shout out to his daughter. 

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Shout out Bonnie. Hello, Bonnie. Yeah. We'll be-, you guys will see that clip again, in the upcoming blog post, and we'll elaborate a little bit there. But unless John wants to do any more talk a little bit more about, like okay. I wasn't sure if you wanna talk about, like, the the playtest at all there and, like, you know but, yeah.

I think I think we'll let the blog post we'll let the we'll let it ride, and and you guys can, read more on the blog post. Wow. That is, that is crazy. That is crazy. That's super exciting.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Cool. Hey. Thanks for having me on. Thank you so much, John Hytale. Everybody in the chat, give it up to for for John Hytale.
Absolutely incredible coming in here and just smashing all expectations and answering some of the coolest questions. I think this makes up for ask Hytale, by the way, but, like, shout out. This has been genuinely amazing. It's been so great to have you guys involved, this year and obviously with the coins and the mystery boxes as well. Reminder, you guys can donate at Hytalethankmas.com for for that stuff as well.

It's so exciting. And then obviously we've got Reyas models, the Scarrak models. Did you see them? Oh, so good. They're so bad.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
Yes. They're so good. I've had several people from the team DM me asking for, their Twitter, just because I'm like, I have a feeling they're probably gonna be messaging, maybe commissions? I don't know. I don't know what they have in mind, but, people from the teams can really love it.

## Connor (Kweebec Corner)
Yeah, I bet. It must be so cool to see like the creation come to life. Like it's gone all the way from being concepted, which I got to see a little sneak peek of when I came over to you guys, you know, in the mid year, all the way to now being handcrafted into a into a real life model. It's gone through the whole evolution of a Hytale mob, in the fan community in within a year. So that's great.

I love it. Awesome. Right. We're gonna roll into a really quick break here so that we can let everybody just take a little bit of a deep breath, stretch your arms and legs, get some water and hydrate. And we are gonna be back with power hour, the return of power hour.

You know it. It's gonna be exciting. After that, we're going to be jumping into the m sir m c server to play Save the Queebex, our minigame, and then following that, we're gonna have a round table where we'll, I'm sure, get into all the juicy details that have been discussed in this last segment.
So a final thank you to Buddha and John and all of the team at Hypixel Studios for, making this year's Thangmas just as special and, just as incredible. Thank you so much.

## Buddhacat (Hypixel Studios, Community Manager)
-Oh, thank you. Thank you, guys. Thanks, everyone involved with Hytale Tankmas. This has been awesome, and thank you to the community, for believing in us and sticking by us. We love you guys.
